# YMseekA
Young adults (18-24yo) of Australia have poor/lack of recognition of mental health issues - A significant barrier to professional help-seeking. 71% of them do not reach out for professional help. And the Australian labour force participation consists of 80% of these young adults. Young Minds seek Assist (YMseekA) is a project targeted at young adults of Australia in the workplace who are going through a depression or suicidal episode and are not aware of it. Our focus is to spread awareness and educate this set of people, since they are the Nation's future.
